# NLP-ML-Starter
Learned about Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Machine Learning, without touching upon deep learning by covering the fundamentals of NLP, its real-world applications, and different approaches to implement it.

Used vectorization Techniques such as Bag of Words(BOW) AND TF-IDF(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical values.
